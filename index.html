      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>
  In a blender, blend the water, instant coffee, eggs, oil, sugar, and cocoa powder until smooth. Transfer to a bowl, add the flour and baking powder, and mix with a spoon. Pour the batter into cupcake liners placed in a cupcake tray, side by side. Bake in a preheated medium oven for 25 minutes or until baked and golden. Remove and let cool.
  <br><br>
  For the filling, cook all the ingredients over medium heat, stirring well until thickened. Turn off the heat, let it cool, and place in a piping bag fitted with a round tip. Set aside. Place the whipped cream in another piping bag fitted with a star tip and set aside.
  <br><br>
  To assemble, make a hole in the center of each cupcake and fill with the reserved coffee brigadeiro. Decorate the tops of the cupcakes with the reserved whipped cream in circular motions. Garnish with coffee beans and refrigerate until ready to serve.
